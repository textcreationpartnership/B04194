            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>Rules concerning Buying Commodities.</head>
               <p n="1">1. IF you would not tranſgreſs Scripture rules in buying; then firſt take heed that you do not diſcommend thoſe Commodities that are very good, which you are about to buy, that ſo you may bring down the price of the Commodity, and get it for leſs than it is worth: There is a known place of Scripture for this, in <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.14. <hi>It is naught, it is naught, ſaith the buyer; but when he is gone his way, then he boaſteth.</hi> People in <hi>Solomons</hi> time they were ſo wicked, that when they came to the market to buy any thing, the buyer he would diſcommend the Commodity, and ſay, <hi>It was naught,</hi> though it were very good and ſaleable; but when the ſeller was gone, then he would boaſt of what a good penny worth he had bought, and the like.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Do not make vows and proteſtations, that you will give no more for a Commodity, than what you have firſt offered, when afterwards you will give more. This is a very commoun thing with Trades-men: You ſhall have a man come to a ſhop, and cheapen a Commodity, and the buyer he will ſay, <hi>He will not give a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more,</hi> and the ſeller will ſay, <hi>He will not take a farthing leſs,</hi> and yet both the buyer <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Now, this is no other than a palpable and downright lye.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Do not give counterfeit, money for thoſe Commodities you buy; this you have an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of in <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he was to buy the field in <hi>Machpelah</hi> of <hi>Ephron</hi> the <hi>Hittite,</hi> for a bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Place, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 23.16. ſaith <hi>Abraham, I will give thee four hundred ſhekels of ſilver, currant money with the merchand;</hi> And therefore you tranſgreſs Scripture rules, if you know you have braſs money, or counterfeit gold about you, and yet pay it away for commodities, you ſin in doing ſo, though you your ſelf took it for Commodities.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Do not give for a commoditie leſs than in your conſcience you think it is worth; It is an open oppreſſion in buying, when you ſeek to bring a Commodity under its due value and worth. <hi>Abraham</hi> when he was to buy the Cave in <hi>Machpelah</hi> of <hi>Ephron,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I will give thee the worth of it in money:</hi> And ſo <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> when he was to buy the threſhing-floor of <hi>Araunah</hi> the <hi>Jebuſite,</hi> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.24. ſaith he <hi>I will buy it of thee at the full value of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Do not long defer the paying for thoſe Commodities which you have bought, when thou haſt by the where with all to pay it: there is an excellent place for this in <hi>Prov.</hi> 3, 27, 28. <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thy hand to do it: ſay not unto thy neighbour, Go and come again, and to morrow I will give, when thou haſt it by thee,</hi> This text is referred to works of mercy, but it hath relation to buying and ſelling, and trading in the world: If you owe a man money for a Commodity, you ought to pay him, and not to let him come day after day for it: and go with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, when you have it by you, 2 <hi>Kings.</hi> 4.7. it is the badge of a wicked man in Scripture, <hi>not to pay his debts,</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.21. <hi>The wicked borroweth and payeth not again.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Do not engroſs a Commodity, that is, do not buy all of a Commodity into your own hands alone, that by that means you may ſell the Commodity at your own price; this is a meer oppreſſion, deſtructive to a Commonwealth, and to all trading; the Scripture condemns this in <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.26. it is ſpoken there of Corn-mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; ſaith the Text. <hi>He that witholdeth corn, the people ſhall curſe him; but bleſſing</hi> ſhall <hi>be upon the head of him that ſelleth it.</hi> In <hi>Solomons</hi> time there were Corn-mongers that when corn was cheap, would go and buy all the corn in the countrey, and would keep it up, and ſell none till corn was very dear; now, ſaith the Text, <hi>He that doth thus, the people ſhall curſe him for it; but bleſſing ſhall be upon the head of him that ſelleth it.</hi> Now, it is no ſin in it-ſelf to engroſs a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, thereby to ſell it the cheaper, but for a man to engroſs a Commodity, meerly thereby to advance the price of it; this is ſuch an oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that the people ſhall curſe him for it.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Do not in your buying a commodity take any advantage of the miſtake or overſight of the ſeller; as ſuppoſe you ſhould come to a ſhop and buy ſo many yards of cloth, or the like, and he ſhould give thee more than is thy due, or take leſs money of thee than is his due, you ſhould take no advantage of him in ſuch a caſe, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore it again: for, if you take any thing more from him than you bought of him, it is theft; or if you give any leſs for the Commodity than you bargand for, it is theft: there is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent place for this in <hi>Gen.</hi> 43.12. <hi>Jacob</hi> when there was a famin in the land, he ſent his ſons down into <hi>Egypt</hi> to buy corn, and <hi>Joſeph</hi> he knowing his brethren, filled their ſacks with corn, and put the money which they brought for the corn, in the mouth of their ſacks again; and when they came home and found their money in the mouth of their ſacks, they told their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Jacob</hi> of it; then ſaith he to them, <hi>Go back again and take double money in your hand, and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your ſacks, carry it again in your hands, for per adventure it was an overſight:</hi> here was a conſcienciouſneſs in <hi>Jacob.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. Do not buy any Commodities on the Lords Day; it is true, upon urgent occaſions to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain life either in man or beaſt, this is lawfull; but to buy any thing, that you may well be without till monday, in this caſe you ſin, if you buy any thing on the Lords Day; <hi>Neh.</hi> 10.31. <hi>And Nehemiah entred into ane oath, and the people with him, that if any of the people of the land brought wares, or any victuals to ſell on the Sabbath day, that they would not buy it of them;</hi> and as the law did not give them leave to break the Jewiſh Sabbath, ſo neither doth the Goſpel give us leave to break the Chriſtian Sabbath; and therefore I cannot ſee but that it is a ſin, for men to buy either wine, or beer, or pepper, or muſtard, or any other trivial things (which they may well be without) on the Sabbath Day.</p>
               <p n="9">9, Do not in buying a commodity, work upon the neceſſity of a poor man, that hath need of money: this is a great ſin in Trades-men; they know that a poor man wants money, and he muſt ſell off his ware, or elſe he cannot buy bread for his family, and therefore they will work upon his neceſſity, and will not buy the Commodity of him, unleſs he will ſell it cheaper then he can afford it; now this is a great oppreſſion, in the 25. of <hi>Levit</hi> 14 <hi>If thou buyeſt any thing of thy neighbour, or ſelleſt any thing to thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, thou muſt not uſe oppreſſion.</hi> There is an oppreſſion in buying as well as in ſelling, it is a great oppreſſion for rich men to work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the neceſſity of a poor man, to make him ſell cheaper then he can afford, or elſe to buy nothing at all of him.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Do not buy thoſe things which are not fit to be bought and ſold: as firſt, Do not buy ſtol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len goods, they are not fit to be bought; if thou knoweſt that the goods that are to be bought are ſtollen goods, they are not to be bought, but to be reſtored; as the receiver is as bad as the theif, ſo the buyer is as bad as the theif: Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Do not buy monuments of Idolatry, for they are not fit to be bought, as Croſſes, Beads, and Images, and Crucifixes, and the like. Thridly, Do not buy Men for ſlaves, this the Lord reproves in <hi>Amos.</hi> 2.6 <hi>They ſold the righteous for ſilver, and the poor for a pair of ſhooes;</hi> and ſo in <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſteall thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and make merchandiſe of him:</hi> We ſhould therefore take heed leſt we ſplit our ſouls upon any of theſe rocks, and let us labour that among all our buyings, we buy that which Chriſt bids us buy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in <hi>Eſay</hi> 55.1. <hi>Ho every one that thriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, c<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <head>Rules Concerning Selling Commodities.</head>
               <p n="1">1. IF you would not tranſgreſs Scripture rules in ſelling Commodities; then in the firſt place do not multiply words in ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; the Scripture affords many examples for this, as in <hi>Gen.</hi> 23.15. <hi>Abraham,</hi> as I told you before, when he was to buy the cave of <hi>Mach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelah,</hi> of <hi>Ephron,</hi> he told him that <hi>it was worth four hundred ſhekels of ſilver,</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> preſently gave him ſo much <hi>currant monie with the merchant:</hi> And ſo God Himſelf takes upon Him to be a ſeller, in <hi>Zech.</hi> 11.12. <hi>if you think good,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>Give me my price; if not, forbear;</hi> multiplicity of words is needleſs; <hi>In a multitude of words</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon) there is ſin:</hi> Men ſhould not laviſh and frolick in a ſhop.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Do not commend and over-praiſe a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, when you know in your conſcience. that there is a fault in it! this is a vicious carriage in the ſeller, when he ſhall uſe abundance of fine words to ſet out a Commodity when it is not good. As the buyer ſhould not diſcommend a Commodity when it is good; ſo ſhould not the ſeller over-praiſe and commend a Commodity, when it is naught.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Do not ſell thy Commodities by falſe weights nor by falſe meaſures; do not keep a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful ballance, or a deceitful meaſure; this is condemned in <hi>Amos.</hi> 8.5. <hi>They make the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phah ſmall, and the Shekel great, and falſifie the <gap reason="illegible" extent="4 letters">
                        <desc>••••</desc>
                     </gap>ances by deceit:</hi> and ſo in the 20. of <hi>Prov.</hi> 10. <hi>Divers weights, and divers meaſures, both of them are alike an abomination unto the Lord.</hi> Now, this is ſpoken, not that the weights and meaſures in themſelves are ane abomination to the Lord, but only thoſe men that do uſe, and keep, and ſell by thoſe weights and meaſures; and therefore the Lord gave a ſpecial law for this, to all that did follow trades in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in <hi>Deut.</hi> 25.14, 15. ſaith God there, <hi>Thou ſhalt not have in thy houſe diverſe meaſures, a great and a ſmall,</hi> that is, a great meaſure to buy by and a ſmall one to ſell by; <hi>Thou ſhalt not have in thy bag divers weights, a great and a ſmall, but thou ſhalt have a perfect and a juſt weight, and a perfect and a juſt meaſure ſhalt thou have, that thy dayes may be long in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee;</hi> and ſo in <hi>Micah.</hi> 6.10. <hi>Is there yet,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>the treaſures of wickedneſs in the houſe of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and the ſcant meaſure, which is an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation unto the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. You are to make conſcience in ſelling a Commodity, not only that you do not ſpeak falſly, but alſo that you do not ſpeak in an equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocating manner: It is an obſervation that <hi>Luther</hi> hath upon theſe words, <hi>Let no man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud his Brother,</hi> ſaith he, there are many Shop-keepers, that will not lye, but they will equivocat, very much: you ſhall have a Tradſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, to ſell off a Commodity he will get a part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with him, and he ſhall offer him ſo much for a Commodity, and then he will tell the next man that comes for that Commodity, that there was one offered him ſo much for it but even now; and then they will ſay likewiſe, it coſt me ſo much, when it may be they had other things with it of a greater value and price, and it may be they had a great deal of time given them to pay for it, Whereas the buyer payes ready mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; and many other equivocating words they uſe, which is as bad as lying.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In ſelling a Commodity, do not work upon the ignorance or ſimplicity of the man that comes to buy the Commodity; but if you diſcern him to be unskilful, rather uſe him the better, than the worſe; in <hi>Zepha.</hi> 1.9. ſayes God there, <hi>In the ſame day alſo will I puniſh all thoſe young men, that leap on the threſhold, which fill their maiſters houſes with violence and deceit?</hi> and ſo in 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Let no man</hi> (ſaves the Apoſtle) <hi>go beyond or defraud his brother in any matter, for the Lord is the avenger of all ſuch;</hi> and ſo in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2, 3. <hi>And through covetouſneſse ſhall they with fained words make merchandiſe of you, whoſe judgement lingereth not.</hi> When men ſhall work upon the ignorance of the buyer, and ſo advance the price of the Commodity; this is a great ſin.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Do not imbaſe a Commodity from its pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive worth and goodneſs, and yet ſell it at the full price, as if it were good, thereby to get the more by it: this the Scripture condemns in <hi>Amos.</hi> 8.6. <hi>They ſell the refuſe of the wheat;</hi> the Corn-mongers, in thoſe times they would pick out the beſt of their wheat, and yet ſell the worſt at the full price of the beſt: now, this the Lord condemns; and ſo in <hi>Eſay,</hi> 1.22. <hi>They mingle wine with water, and droſs with ſilver:</hi> the Scripture condemns this, to imbaſe a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity from its primitive goodneſs, and yet to ſell it at the full value of the beſt.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Be not among the firſt that ſhall raiſe the price of a Commodity; this I hinted to you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.26. <hi>He that witholdeth corn the people ſhall curſe him; but bleſſing ſhall be upon the head of him that ſelleth it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. Be not ſo eager in ſelling of your Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, that you cannot content yourſelves to ſell on the ſix dayes of the week, but you muſt ſell on the Sabbath Day likewiſe; be not like thoſe in <hi>Amos.</hi> 8.5. ſaying, <hi>When will the new moon be over, that we may ſell corn, and the Sabbath be over, that we may ſet forth wheat?</hi> and ſo in <hi>Neh.</hi> 13.15. <hi>In thoſe dayes,</hi> ſaith the Prophet <hi>ſaw I in Judah, ſome treading wine-preſſes on the Sabbath, and bringing in ſheaves, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Aſſes, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jeruſalem on the Sabbath and I teſtified againſt them in the day wherein they ſold victuales.</hi> Now, this is againſt your common ſelling-houſes, and ſhops of mean trades, that ſell by retail, that make nothing of ſelling ſmall trifling things on the Sabbath Day but this is a great ſin.</p>
               <p n="9">9. When you are found out to be deceitful in your dealing, do not juſtifie your deceit; many men, if you come to them, &amp; tell them, that they ſell dearer then their neighbours, they will tell you, that they do not; or if you tell them that the Commodity is not good which you bought of them, they will ſay, it is as good as they can afford for the price, and the like; this is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in <hi>Ephraim,</hi> in <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12.7, 8. <hi>Ephraim is a Merchant, the ballances of deceit are in his hand, he loveth to oppreſſe, and yet he ſaith, I am become rich, and I have found me out ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and in all my labours they ſhall find no iniquity in me,</hi> that is ſin; you ſhould not juſtifie your deceit.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Do not ſell thoſe things that are not ſale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; as firſt, do not ſell ſpiritual things, for they are not ſaleable, as in <hi>Act.</hi> 8.20. <hi>Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> when he would have bought the gift of the holy Ghoſt with money <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith to him, <hi>Thy money periſh with thee, becauſe thou thoughteſt that the gift of God might be purchaſed with money.</hi> Secondly, do not ſell monumentes of Idolatrie; as Croſſes, and Beads, and Images and Crucifixes, and conjuring Books, and the like; they are not fit to be ſold, as in <hi>Act.</hi> 19.19. <hi>many alſo of them that uſed curious arts, brought their books together, and burned them before all men and they counted the price of them and found it to be</hi> 50000. <hi>pieces of ſilver;</hi> this is ſpoken here of conjuring Books; and notwithſtanding they were of ſo great a value, they would not ſell them, but burned them. Thirdly, Do not ſell thy ſelf as <hi>Ahab</hi> did, to work wickedneſſe; for you are not your own, but Gods; and therefore you muſt <hi>glorifie God in your bodies, and in your ſouls which are Gods.</hi> Fourthly, You muſt not ſell ſtollen goods. Fifthly, You muſt not ſell thoſe things that are for no other uſe, but for to commit ſin in the uſing of them; as for to ſell ſtuffe to paint harlots faces, is a ſin, becauſe it is for no other uſe but to commit ſin in the uſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it.</p>
